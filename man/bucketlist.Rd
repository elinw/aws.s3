\details{
\code{bucketlist} performs a GET operation on the base s3 endpoint and returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request. If authentication is successful, this function provides a list of buckets available to the authenticated user. In this way, it can serve as a \dQuote{hello world!} function, to confirm that one's authentication credentials are working correctly.
